                    <p>Most people see me as just another high school student from Karakura Town, but my life is far from ordinary. Ever since I was a kid, I've had the ability to see spirits—something that set me apart even before I officially became a Substitute Soul Reaper. When I met Rukia Kuchiki, my world turned upside down, and I was thrown into a life of battles, responsibilities, and protecting both the living and the dead.</p>
                    <p>I may not have asked for this life, but I've accepted my role. No matter what stands in my way—whether it's Hollows, Soul Reapers, Arrancars, or Quincies—I will fight to protect those who cannot protect themselves.</p>

                    <h4>🔥 Martial Arts & Fighting</h4>
                    <p>I've trained in martial arts since I was a kid, thanks to my dad (who is much stronger than he looks). I don't just rely on my Zanpakutō—I believe in raw combat skills and physical strength, which have helped me survive against the strongest enemies.</p>

My sisters, Karin and Yuzu, are my responsibility, and I'd do anything to keep them safe. My friends—Orihime, Chad, Uryū, and Rukia—are more than just allies. They're my family too.</p>

Whether it's unlocking my Bankai in three days or controlling my Hollow powers, I never stop training. I won't allow myself to be weak when my strength is needed.</p>
